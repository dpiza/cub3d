## Description

This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which was the first FPS ever. In this project, we explore the concepts of ray-casting.

## Goals

This is the second project in which we use the graphical library [`miniLibX`](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux), and my new favorite.
The goal is to make a dynamic view inside a maze.

## Mandatory

• Smooth window management;

• Display different wall textures that vary deppending on which side the wall is facing;

• Set the floor and the ceiling to two different colors;

• Set the following key binding:
   - W A S D to move the point of view through the maze;
   - ← and → arrow keys to rotate the camera;
   - ESC to close the window and quit the program cleanly, so as the red cross.

• Use of images of the minilibX;

• Validate the map files;

• Print **Error\n** followed by an explicit error message for invalid maps.

## Bonus

• Wall collision;

• Minimap system;

• Doors which can be open and close;

• Animated sprite;

• Rotate the point of view with the mouse.

## Extra Features

It was so much fun doing this project, that I couldn't miss the opportunity to add a few bonuses of my own:

• A NPC;

• A quest with a quest log system;

• Enemies that chase the player until they are defeated;

• HUD bar with multiple menu options, such as:
   - Quest log - that updates with the quest progression;
   - Inventory - also updated when the quest items are collected;
   - Minimap;
   - Character information (roleplay only);
   - Character status (roleplay only);
   - Animated interaction button.
   - Shadow applied to walls, sprites, floor and ceiling

• Visual feedback when the player takes damage.
